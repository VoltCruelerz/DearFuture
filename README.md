# DearFuture
A time capsule to take advantage of the long-term archive of github under https://archiveprogram.github.com/

Through this, I and any others who wish to participate, may send messages to the future.

To any who wish to contribute, please feel free and create a new .md file with your github username inside the Letters directory.  I would recommend focusing on issues that are descriptive of your lifestyle and your perspective of the little things.  So often, history recounts the major events, but often has a difficult time intimately grasping what life was like.

It is possible that this, like all time capsules, may never see the light of day, or that archeologists of the future will not be able to decipher the data, but it is hoped that this can provide some insight to future generations of humans or whatever may come after us.  The cold storage should be good for 1000 years, but Microsoft's Project Silica could go for 10,000.  10,000 years ago, we humans were only just learning about this new-fangled thing called "farming."  Consider how far we have advanced since that day.
